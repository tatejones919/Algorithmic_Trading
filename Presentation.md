## Project Description

- We will be using three different assets to generate buy and sell signals.
- One FOREX pair, EURUSD (Euro vs US Dollar), one cryptocurrency pair, BTCUSD (Bitcoin vs US Dollar), and one metal, XAUUSD (Gold Spot vs US Dollar).
- **The goal of our project will be to create an algo trading bot that will execute buy/sell signals generated by our predictive model.**

## Hypothesis of Our Project

- EURUSD and BTCUSD have observed relationships with Gold.
- When Gold moves long, so does EURUSD. But, BTCUSD shorts.
- When Gold shorts, so does EURUSD. But, BTCUSD moves long.
- Using this information, we will create buy/sell signals for EURUSD and BTCUSD based off of the directional bias of Gold.

## Model Summary

- 50-day short term moving average
- 100-day long term moving average
- Bollinger Bands

> These moving averages were used to determine crossover points. We created a predictive model using machine learning with indicators using short and long expontential weighted moving averages (ewm). The ewm standard deviation to indicate volitilty. Bollinger Bands were also used as an indicator for the predictive model.

- RandomForest Model

> We used a 70/30 test/train split and used the 3 indicators above as predictive training indicators.

> A Random Forest Model combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result.

## Datasets To Be Used

- Data sets provided by Alpha Vantage for EURUSD and BTCUSD.
- Data set provided by Investing.com for XAUUSD.

## Data Cleanup & Model Training

We built a simple moving average model to determine buy and sell signals. This model we used to compare to the machine learning model.

We used Aplha Vantage's API to gather data for EURUSD and BTCUSD. Able to gather historical data for Gold: date, and closing prices.

For the model training, we found certain feature points (crossover signal, bollinger signal, and volitity trend signal) for ewms and the bollinger bands. With positive returns being the thing we wanted to predict.
