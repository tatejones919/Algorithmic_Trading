### Project Description

- We will be using three different assets to generate buy and sell signals.
- One FOREX pair, EURUSD (Euro vs US Dollar), one cryptocurrency pair, BTCUSD (Bitcoin vs US Dollar), and one metal, XAUUSD (Gold Spot vs US Dollar).
- **The goal of our project will be to create an algo trading bot that will execute buy/sell signals generated by our predictive model.**

### Hypothesis of Our Project

- EURUSD and BTCUSD have observed relationships with Gold.
- When Gold moves long, so does EURUSD. But, BTCUSD shorts.
- When Gold shorts, so does EURUSD. But, BTCUSD moves long.
- Using this information, we will create buy/sell signals for EURUSD and BTCUSD based off of the directional bias of Gold.

### Datasets To Be Used

- Data sets provided by Alpha Vantage for EURUSD and BTCUSD.
- Data set provided by Investing.com for XAUUSD.

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks

- To be discussed.
